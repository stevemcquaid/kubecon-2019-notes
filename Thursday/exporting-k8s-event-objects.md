# Exporting Kubernetes Event Objects for Better Observability

*Speaker: Mustafa Akin & Ahmet Seker, Atlassian*

* Opsgenie Event Exporter
    * multiple outputs to plug into slack, splunk, etc
    * rate, output, & payload customization
    * collector is containerized
* How similar is this to the goal of Sloop? How can we make Kubernetes errors more visible to our developers?
    * A large percentage of the time our devs have to engage a spinnaker or mcn admin to help troubleshoot. 
    * What can we be doing differently? - Joint splunk dashboard of spinnaker/k8s logs per app? 
    * What does prometheus and grafana dashboards show us already in terms of application errors?
